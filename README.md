You can change "claimed_privacy" as per your requirement

in the detect_counterexample function you can change the value of event_iterations and detect_iterations.


To run the code
python3.10 or earlier versions should be installed

type
example.py

It would now run on local machine/Workstation , but it'll going to take a lot of space , so codespaces is recommended
